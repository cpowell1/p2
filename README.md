## Outside resources
 * [How to Write Multi-Dimensional Array](https://daylerees.com/php-pandas-arrays/) I used this resource when I needed to write an array for my data about the dog's age and size.
 * Class Notes

## 3 Unique inputs
1. Text field to indicate the pet's name
2. Dropdown to indicate the pet's weight
3. Checkbox to indicate the pet's age

## Class
Form.php

## Code style divergences
 * No Divergence

## Notes for instructor
Thank you for the help walking me through each of the issues I encountered. I validated the code with the W3C Validator, and there were errors shown, but it was the PHP it highlighted as an error.
