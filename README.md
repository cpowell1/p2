## Outside resources
 * [How to Write Multi-Dimensional Array](https://daylerees.com/php-pandas-arrays/) I used this resource when I needed to write an array for my data about the dog's age and size.
 * [Nutro Dog Logo](https://seeklogo.com/vector-logo/101575/nutro-choice)
 * Class Notes

## 3 Unique inputs
1. Text field to indicate the pet's name
2. Dropdown to indicate the pet's weight
3. Checkbox to indicate the pet's age

## Class
Form.php

## Code style divergences
 * No Divergence

## Notes for instructor
Thank you for the help walking me through each of the issues I encountered. I validated the code with the W3C Validator, and there were errors shown, but it was the PHP it highlighted as an error. Also, the second submission includes my updated ReadMe file that cites the image source I used.
